# Machine Learning

## Overview
Simple Machine Learning library written in C++

Provides Neural Network and basic linear algebra libraries with examples

## Setup
Project is done in Visual Studio 2022, so open .sln file

## Features
- Backpropagation
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Multiple activation functions (Sigmiod, ReLU, Tanh)
- Layers Randomization
- Saving and loading model
- Example of learning XOR operation and drawing and recognizing digits

## Preview

## Next steps
There is a lot more which can be done. Here are some examples I came across:
- Convolutional / Recurrent Neural Networks
- Nvidia CUDA acceleration
- Transformers (Word embedding, etc.)
- Adam Optimizer for gradient descent
