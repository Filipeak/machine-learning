# Neural Networks

## Overview
Simple Machine Learning library written in C++

Provides Neural Network and basic linear algebra libraries with examples

## Setup
Project is done in Visual Studio 2022, so open .sln file

## Features
- Backpropagation
- Multiple activation functions (Sigmiod, ReLU, Tanh)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Layers Randomization
- Saving and loading model
- Example of learning XOR operation and drawing and recognizing digits
