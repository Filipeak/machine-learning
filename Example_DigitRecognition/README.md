# Digit Recognition

In the 'mnist' folder you have training data with pre-trained model. To train by yourself set ```TRAINING_BUILD``` in ```src/Config.h``` to 1, otherwise leave it 0.

Visualization is done using OpenGL with GLFW (see 'dependencies' folder).

Due to too few training data (around 1000 images) it is pretty sensitive.
